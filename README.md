# gpdb-demo-release

A BOSH release of GPDB's demo-cluster

## Origin and purpose

A hackathon project at CF Summit Silicon Valley, June 2017

We recognize that efforts to [make a BOSH
release](https://bosh.io/docs/create-release.html)
from [Greenplum Database](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpdb) have been
attempted before. But we wanted to try again to get something simple working
and to learn more about both products.
